## 22/05/2023 About the Code 
 ``` Please don't question the awfulness of all the code written on that date. Because after 2 years, I learned how much of an asset and stupid person I am. But at least I tried my luck :) And 2 times in a row! Think about it, maybe I'll get my 3rd chance sometime! Anyway I'm a bit depressed but fuck it if the code works! Don't worry, I'll fix everything later.```
